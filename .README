## Setup Instructions

### Backend

1. Navigate to the backend directory:

   ```bash
   cd path/to/todo_project
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # For Unix/Mac
   venv\Scripts\activate  # For Windows
   ```

3. Install the Django dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Apply migrations and start the server:
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   python manage.py runserver
   ```
